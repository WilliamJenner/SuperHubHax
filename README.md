# SuperHubHax

This project was created to allow me play around with my home routers (Virgin Media Superhub 2) browser portal, without using the browser.

Since there is no public API for the router, I have been looking into the HTTP forms sent when interacting with the internet portal.



-- I have mostly abandoned this - was a fun project for an afternoon but it never got anywhere
